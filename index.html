			<h1> About Me</h1>
			 	<p>I am currently a student at <a href = "http://www.themakersquare.com">MakerSquare</a>, a 10-week intensive web development workshop based in Austin.</p>
			 	<p> I am originally from Philly, and while in school I studied Linguistics. </p>
			 	<p> I love travel and have an insatiable wanderlust. So far I've only managed to get to Brazil, Costa Rica, and the Azores (eh, and there's Canada), but I'm hoping to get to at least four more continents as soon as I can. </p>
				<p> My interest in web development was piqued by my desire to be able to create things that will be able to positively impact people throughout the world. New technology has dramatically transformed the way people have lived in a short period of time, and that trend is only accelerating. Rather than wondering what the future holds and who will create the next best thing, I've decided that an even better idea will be to begin learning these skills so that I can create change myself. </p>


		<div class = "studying present">
			<h1>What I'm Studying</h1> 
				<p>I am learning all sorts of concepts about web design and development at <a href = "http://themakersquare.com">MakerSquare</a>, including <em>HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, Javascript, JQuery,</em> and various <em>APIs</em> that will allow us to make web applications. </p>

			<h1>Development Interests</h1>
			<p> At the moment I am interested in all aspects on web development and I just want to learn. however, if I had to pick one area of expertise that I'd like to develop, it would definitely be <em>Natural Language Processing</em>. The idea of being able to create applications that can be used to manipulate and create human language is one I find fascinating. </p>
			<p> I am also interested in learning more about the development of web applications in places where a great deal of development is still taking place. I have read a lot about how web applications have been used to make a great impact in all sorts of areas including banking, health care, and education. </p>

		<div class = "creations present">
			<h1>Applications I'd Like to Create</h1>
		<p> I'd like to try my hand at some of the following applications in order to hone my skills:</p>
			<div class = "list">
				<ul>
					<li class="one"><span>A tokenizer and/or a parser for language</span></li>
					<li class="two"><span>An note-taking/storing application similar to Evernote -- there are some tweaks I'd like to make!</li>
					<li class="one"><span>A goal tracking application -- allows to break goals into subgoals, and will the ability to set
					reminders at appropriate increments to keep the user on track.</span> </li>
					<li class="two"><span> Language learning application that will allow for easy generation of flashcards and quizzes after user selects and saves words from online sources. </span></li>
					<li class="one"><span>A consultant locator -- something similar to a store locator, but for people rather than stores</span></li>
					<li class="two"><span>A "Where I've Been" interactive map</span></li>
					<li class="one"><span>The big kahuna -- An airfare search engine/deals website</span></li>
